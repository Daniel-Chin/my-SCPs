**Item #:** SCP-XXXX

**Object Class:** --safe-- Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-XXXX is contained in a locker whose diagonal length is no longer than 5cm. 

**Description:** 
SCP-XXXX is a pair of identical metal balls, labeled SCP-XXXX-0 and SCP-XXXX-1. The diameter of each ball is 1.928 cm and the weight is 34.0611534 g. There is always a repulsive force between the two balls. 

The anomoly of SCP-XXXX lies in how the repulsive force responds to the distance between the two balls. Unlike most physical forces which follow the inverse square law, SCP-XXXX follows a not-inverse square law - the repulsive force is proportional to the //square// of the distance between the two balls: 

//f// = //k// × //d//^^2^^
where //d// is the distance between the two balls, //f// is the resulting repulsive force, and //k// is a constant number. Foundation measurements have shown that //k// = 426.7998 ± 0.0001 N/m^^2^^. 

||~ distance ||~ repulsive force ||~ equivalent weight ||
||= 1.928 cm ||= 0.16 N ||= a tablespoon ||
||= 5 cm ||= 1.07 N ||= half cup of water ||
||= 1 m ||= 427 N ||= a 15-year-old girl ||
||= 5 m ||= 10670 N ||= a compact car ||
||= 20 m ||= 1.7 × 10^^5^^ N ||= ??? ||

Computer simulations of SCP-XXXX under free acceleration show alarming results. Suppose that a clip was holding the two balls in contact. If the clip was to be removed at //t// = 0 s and SCP-XXXX was allowed to freely accelerate, then at //t// = 0.135 s SCP-XXXX starts to gain significant velocity. The high velocity quickly increases the distance, which in turns amplifies the repulsive force by many folds. By //t// = 0.136 s, the velocity has risen to 3.4 × 10^^198^^ m/s and the distance 6.7 × 10^^194^^ m. Afterwards (//t// > 0.136 s), unmanageable overflow immediately crashes any simulation attempts. The figure below shows the simulated trajectory up to //t// = 0.136 s.

**Addendum:** 

[[collapsible show="+ [show] Log: initial procurement" hide="- [hide] Log: initial procurement"]]
    The Foundation found SCP-XXXX during a sweep at ████████████ on Apr. ██, 2021 along with other abnormal objects including SCP-████, SCP-████, and SCP-████. Field agents reported no apparent anomolies related to SCP-XXXX other than a faint repulsive force when they handled SCP-XXXX-0 and SCP-XXXX-1. During the transportation to site-██, SCP-XXXX happened to be contained in a 3 cm-by-3 cm plastic bag. 
    SCP-XXXX was classified as **safe**. Several foundation researchers expressed interest in SCP-XXXX because of SCP-XXXX's behavioral resemblance to a //magnetic monopole//. However, most of the researchers
