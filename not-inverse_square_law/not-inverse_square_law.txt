**Item #:** SCP-XXXX

**Object Class:** --safe-- Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-XXXX should be contained in a locker whose diagonal length is no longer than 6 cm. 

**Description:** 
SCP-XXXX is a pair of identical metal balls, labeled SCP-XXXX-0 and SCP-XXXX-1. The diameter of each ball is 1.928 cm and the weight is 34.0611534 g. There is always a repulsive force between the two balls. 

The anomoly of SCP-XXXX lies in how the repulsive force responds to the distance between the two balls. Unlike most physical forces which follow the inverse square law, SCP-XXXX follows a not-inverse square law - the repulsive force is proportional to the //square// of the distance between the two balls: 

//f// = //k// × //d//^^2^^
where //d// is the distance between the two balls, //f// is the resulting repulsive force, and //k// is a constant number. Foundation measurements have shown that //k// = 426.7998 ± 0.0001 N/m^^2^^.

||= 5 m ||= 10670 N ||= a compact car ||

Computer simulations of SCP-XXXX under free acceleration show alarming results. Suppose that some glue was holding the two balls in contact. If the glue was to be removed at //t// = 0 s and SCP-XXXX was allowed to freely accelerate, then at //t// = 0.135 s SCP-XXXX starts to gain significant velocity. The high velocity quickly increases the distance, which in turns amplifies the repulsive force by many folds. By //t// = 0.136 s, the velocity has risen to 3.4 × 10^^198^^ m/s and the distance 6.7 × 10^^194^^ m. Afterwards (//t// > 0.136 s), unmanageable overflow immediately crashes any simulation attempts. The figure below shows the simulated trajectory up to //t// = 0.136 s.

**Addendum:** 

[[collapsible show="+ [show] Log: initial procurement" hide="- [hide] **Log: initial procurement**"]]
    The Foundation found SCP-XXXX during the 2021 April ██^^██^^ sweep at ████████████ along with other novel objects including SCP-████, SCP-████, and SCP-████. Field agents reported no apparent anomalies related to SCP-XXXX other than a faint repulsive force felt when holding SCP-XXXX-0 and SCP-XXXX-1 in the palm. During its transportation to site-██, SCP-XXXX happened to be contained in a 4 cm-by-4 cm plastic bag. 
    
    SCP-XXXX was classified as **safe**. Several foundation researchers expressed interest in SCP-XXXX because of its behavioral resemblance to //magnetic monopoles//. However, most of the researchers was engaging in other containment projects so experiment sessions with SCP-XXXX were delayed to June 2021. During the two months from April to June, SCP-XXXX was to be temporarily contained in a standard bullet-proof locker.

    The following events are recroded on April 28^^th^^, 2021. 
    
    **04:33:30**
    site-██'s sound surveillance system reports a loud sound originating from the bullet-proof locker containing SCP-XXXX. 
    
    **04:34:59**
    The response team arrived at the locker and observed no structural damage to the locker on the outside. 
    
    **04:36:02**
    The response team applied acoustic resonance imaging to probe the inside of the locker. Results showed that SCP-XXXX was at two diagonally opposing corners of the locker and these locker corners were under 600 N of stress. 
    
    **04:36:31**
    Object class "safe" revoked; new object class pending. Locker reinforced externally. Acoustic resonance imaging is applied every other minute to monitor the repulsive force. 
    
    **04:55:28**
    SCP-XXXX safely removed from the locker. Also in the locker was found a 4 cm-by-4 cm plastic bag with a hole in its corner. The plastic bag seems to have gone through a slow process of plastic deformation. 
    
    **05:20:44**
    SCP-XXXX transferred to Engineering Lab 11 for immediate testing.

    > Dr. Bin and I conducted testing on SCP-XXXX immediately after its locker incident. Here I summarize our findings. 
    > 
    > The repulsive force between the two balls follows a //not-inverse// square law. In other words, the further away are the two balls, the larger is the repulsive force. This is a miraculous behavior in physics, but also unthinkably dangerous. Think about what this means - the kinetic energy of the two balls, in their current state, is stupidly high. If the distance between the balls ever becomes too large, subsequent divergence of the two balls will be beyond anyone's control. 
    > 
    > If you release the two balls on the Earth's surface and let them diverge vertically, one ball will easily pierce through the entire Earth, transferring an astronomical amount of kinetic energy during the process. Now, in case the reader is bad at physics, yes, it //is// an end-of-the-world scenario. 
    > 
    > Given the tremendous risks associated with these balls, Dr. Bin and I are drafting some neutralization plans. Among those, the //orbital release// solution seems particularly promising to me; it'll probably solve our problem once and for all. Expect our draft to be finished soon. 
    > 
    > However, note that we are in need of more tests on SCP-XXXX. What is the ratio between the squared distance and the repulsion force? Does it depend on the body mass? What happens if we chop one ball into two, or dissolve it in acid? Do they interact with normal magnets? This is not for science. We need a more exact description of SCP-XXXX's behaviors in order to model the containment and neutralization procedures. 
    > 
    > And by the way, this thing should be Keter.
