**Item #:** SCP-XXXX

**Object Class:** --safe-- Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-XXXX should be contained in a locker whose diagonal length is no longer than 6 cm. 

**Description:** 
SCP-XXXX is a pair of identical metal balls, labeled SCP-XXXX-0 and SCP-XXXX-1. The diameter of each ball is 1.928 cm and the weight is 34.0611534 g. There is always a repulsive force between the two balls. 

The anomoly of SCP-XXXX lies in how the repulsive force responds to the distance between the two balls. Unlike most physical forces which follow the inverse square law, SCP-XXXX follows a not-inverse square law - the repulsive force is proportional to the //square// of the distance between the two balls: 

//f// = //k// × //d//^^2^^
where //d// is the distance between the two balls, //f// is the resulting repulsive force, and //k// is a constant number. Foundation measurements have shown that //k// = 426.7998 ± 0.0001 N/m^^2^^.

Computer simulations of SCP-XXXX under free acceleration show alarming results. Suppose that some glue was holding the two balls in contact. If the glue was to be removed at //t// = 0 s and SCP-XXXX was allowed to freely accelerate, then at //t// = 0.135 s SCP-XXXX starts to gain significant velocity. The high velocity quickly increases the distance, which in turns amplifies the repulsive force by many folds. By //t// = 0.136 s, the velocity has risen to 3.4 × 10^^198^^ m/s and the distance 6.7 × 10^^194^^ m. Afterwards (//t// > 0.136 s), unmanageable overflow immediately crashes any simulation attempts. The figure below shows the simulated trajectory up to //t// = 0.136 s.

**Addendum:** 

[[collapsible show="+ [show] Log: initial procurement" hide="- [hide] Log: initial procurement"]]
    The Foundation found SCP-XXXX during the 2021 April ██^^██^^ sweep at ████████████ along with other novel objects including SCP-████, SCP-████, and SCP-████. Field agents reported no apparent anomalies related to SCP-XXXX other than a faint repulsive force felt when holding SCP-XXXX-0 and SCP-XXXX-1 in the palm. During its transportation to site-██, SCP-XXXX happened to be contained in a 4 cm-by-4 cm plastic bag. 
    
    SCP-XXXX was classified as **safe**. Several foundation researchers expressed interest in SCP-XXXX because of its behavioral resemblance to //magnetic monopoles//. However, most of the researchers was engaging in other containment projects so experiment sessions with SCP-XXXX were delayed to June 2021. During the two months from April to June, SCP-XXXX was to be temporarily contained in a standard bullet-proof locker.

    76 hours after containing SCP-XXXX in the bullet-proof locker, a very loud noise originating from that locker was reported by site-██'s sound surveillance system. 
    
    The response team on duty arrived at the locker and observed no structural damage to the locker on the outside. According to records, the locker had three vertically stacked cells. The upper cell and the lower cell were empty, and the middle cell contained SCP-XXXX. The locker had no windows so the team applied acoustic resonance imaging to probe the inside of the locker. 
    
    Acoustic resonance imaging showed that the two plates separating the three cells had been broken; SCP-XXXX was at two diagonally opposing corners of the locker; and these locker corners were under 600 N of stress. The response team inferred that SCP-XXXX's repulsive force increased over time and immediately alarmed the site overseer. Three engineers were gathered on-site and a re-containment expert panel was assembled for remote support. Meanwhile, SCP-XXXX's object class, //safe//, was revoked; new object class pending. 
    
    Opening the locker door would let out one instance of SCP-XXXX, so the engineer team welded the door shut. The locker was then reinforced by additional external structures. The engineers started working on melting the center of the locker door for an opening. The re-containment expert panel instructed them to monitor the repulsive force via acoustic resonanced imaging every other minute, but no change in the force magnitude was observed throughout the process. 
    
    After 26 minutes of work, the team obtained an access hole of sufficient size. Visual inspection inside the locker confirmed the results from acoustic resonanced imaging. 
    
    The locker cell designated to SCP-XXXX was 15 cm (depth) by 20 cm (width) by 120 cm (height). Three levels. plastic bag. plastic deformation
